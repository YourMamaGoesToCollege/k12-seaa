# Proposal Brief

## Prompt

I need you to create for me a brief that contains the argument of pivoting the current project modality to focus on the core features, core infrastructure, and cross concerns, core data, migration, and operational database

I presented the stakeholders presentation yesterday to a subset of the IT stakeholders management team. Two individuals that do not have a technology role or a clearly defined or conventional product role within this specific project.

They attempted to distill three days of my work and research on this topic to a few bullet points in a ridiculous decision, matrix in order to provide a pathway for a continued ignorance of several technology, design flaws, architectural abnormalities, current failed project.

For example, the main product manager for the project indicated that based on a video presentation from the existing project or a request from the legacy stakeholders that they would like a query builder tool to manage the recipient list for all email communications for the next or modernization K-12 system. This means that she believes that all of the core communications that go to households and students, providers, schools, and their representatives will all be self managed by some administrator or admin functionality that requires them to create the recipient list from a quarry builder tool. This would rely on them, having intimate knowledge of all of the data and business logic, other rules and factors to select and filter the correct recipient list for each of theemail communications that need to go out for the entire system. I see the value of perhaps using a Quarry builder tool in order to select a recipient list for an ad hoc email communication… However, putting a human in the loop in an automated. Email communications that need to go out for the entire system. I see the value of perhaps using a Quarry builder tool in order to select a recipient list for an ad hoc email communication… However, putting a human in the loop in a automated event driven process in my opinion is ridiculous and should be part of the course system logic.

The main focus of the current project that has been going on for the last year seems to be providing a local code or no code solution to the client. The client already has a technology team that should or needs to be able to manage the delivered project when it is modernized and transferred to them. However,. It appears that they are willing to manufacture and create unrealistic and unconventional enterprise features to accommodate the whims and desires of non-technical stakeholders and their current clients request.

I understand that satisfying the client needs and wants is a good thing from a consulting standpoint. However, as a consulting company, it is also the responsibility to help them with decisions that will potentially harm or cost too much to deliver. Or the value and or the return on investment is too little.

The topic that has the current consulting company stakeholders panties in a twist and wad is that they promised them a dynamic enrollment builder

I believe the current product team misunderstood the requirements. They did not understand the actual proof of concept comments from the original architect of the enrollment builder system. The original POC present presentation mentioned that the dynamic enrollment builder can only collect new data elements alone. That any new data collected using this tool cannot be used within the K2 core system without developer and software changes.

They have ignored this specific line of reference in the original presentation during the last year. Therefore, they believe they are delivering a completely dynamic form builder engine and form dynamic form renderer that is based on a naïve POC with an extremely chatty interface between the UI and the backend system. In fact, the UI has an administrative tool to allow specialized administrators. The number of them being about two individuals, targeted, will be responsible for creating the enrollment or registration forms for households, schools, and providers. Their belief is that when the legislation of the state of North Carolina indicates they need a new data element to be collected for a new fiscal year that there will be no enrollment form changes. Or the change would be a no code or low code solution in the new data element collected with magically Update, API payloads, data validation, database schemas for the core K-12 system, and be used to make decisions or to be a part of the core day to day decisions without any technology or developer or software changes.

The current enrollment builder creates a definition of the form based on a configuration of individual form filled elements. The collection of form fields is used to represent a specific program enrollment for a specific fiscal year. They will need to create a dynamic program for households, providers, and schools to collect the information That is required for the core static database schema. The K-12 system will not work without collecting the essential and require required information from households, students, providers and schools.

My logic, and also from other product owners and individual software engineers and architects is that the core data regardless of a dynamic form builder called enrollment builder is required for the K-12 solution to be operational. There’s little value to create a risky and expensive solution to collect required information. In fact, the current enrollment builders solution is naïve in its workflow state management and transitions from one form to the next. It does not use a conventional State machine pattern or a State machine framework such as XState or Stately. It is a homegrown POC quickly put together to demonstrate a potential possibility of dynamically, adding a metadata property or filled to collect, but with the caveat that this information collected would not be part of the core data elements of the K12 system.

Issues:

No use of conventional design patterns or frameworks to manage the workflow of the data collection process.
The configuration of a workflow designed using a moment builder is managed on the backend and access via an API. This requires an API call to manage every transition in the workflow process from one form to another. This creates a very chatty interface between the UI and the API to transition from data collection sub forms within a specific program.
The UI has a specific dependency on all transitions, and therefore requires an API request to know what form to transition to next or if they are on the end state of the workflow.
To add additional complexity to the current system, on all API transactions between the UI and the API in the backend all data elements collected using the enrollment builder is persisted into a micro database in a sub optimal schema that represents the collected data for the specific program and target user via a common or correlation session ID. To allow them to start the collection process without finishing and providing the ability to come back and pick up from where they left off to add more data information to complete the entire process of the enrollment registration.
As indicated by the current product manager, during the enrollment process for households, they will need to create an account, login using the new credentials, provide the registration and enrollment information for the household and watermark students, be directed to a dashboard application to get a list of tasks for them to complete their registration process this means that the enrollment builder system will partially collect some information during the registration process for the household and students and then a dashboard application that is different will be used to direct them to go to another enrollment builder set up forms to finish the registration process, possibly to provide additional information based on the scholarship program or assistance program, they are targeting into upload specific documents or verification items or provide verification items to form input to complete their registration process. This means that the processing of data collected by the enrollment builder will need to be handled in real time by a new tool to defined as a data mapper. The data mapper will need to transform the collected data from the micro database, using a naïve schema and transform that data into the core database schema tables so that the tasking engine in the core system features will be enabled to manage the or finish the enrollment process for a household and their students. Disposes the problem of where the database or data source of truth lives when a session is picked up at a later point in time. Or, if the registrar has to update current information. This little tidbit of information was just discovered this week and not part of the original architectural data map plan. The current data plan indicates that this would be a scheduled or crimen job that takes this information after a registration. And move it to the dedicated core database schema.
The problem that we have today with this project is that it is entirely driven by product individuals that have little to know technology expertise. However, they are designing a system without the input of engineering. Or if they have received input from engineering, they ignore the details or the opposition because they want to deliver what they want to deliver, despite the technical or nonconventional, or simply ridiculous patterns for an enterprise solution.

The enrollment builder provides a solution for a problem. They never really asked to be solved. However, one problem the client did ask to be resolved is an issue when the system is at capacity meaning they have a high number of concurrent users. The KThe enrollment builder provides a solution for a problem. They never really asked to be solved. However, one problem the client did ask to be resolved is a issue when the system is at capacity meaning they have a high number of concurrent users. The K-12 system will crash during registration periods when they have multiple households Attempting to register or renew their enrollment for the next fiscal school year. With the introduction of the current enrollment builder tool process bullshit. They have introduced a layer of chattiness between a UI and API during the most critical time of the system when it is at load or capacity. This creates contention of read rights from the database and possible database deadlock issues during this highly transactional period of time of registration activities. We are attempting to mitigate the Haley transaction, highly transactional registration periods by using a micro service approach on the API. It’s in the back end However, with the introduction of the enrollment builder, this will require expanding the micro service implementation to include a broader range of data operations during the registration process. Original architects and myself believed that we could isolate the registration process and provide discrete one way data operations to opera to optimize the collection of information During the registration process so that we could scale the API implementations to accommodate for the high volume of transactions and number of concurrent users.

The so-called data map or solution is a major risk because it takes structure data and requires the data of my solution to dynamically map the structured data to map and populate a static data schema. The data collected needs to be flawless in its collection of required information from students, households, schools, and providers of services for the K-12 system

The current team has never built a dynamic solution of this sort. The current enrollment builder solves the wrong problem. There is no low code or no code solution for adding new data elements as required from the legislation. In fact, it has been indicated that it is rare or only happens once a year that a new data requirement is asked for for a new fiscal year registration process. Therefore, they created an elaborate and risky system to accommodate a single requirement that could be solved by a few hours of engineering effort. However, they created a monster that will need to be managed to maintain for several and years Where the return on investment will take a considerable amount of time in years.

My recommendation is that they pause or stop the development of the enrollment builder and data map solution. My recommendation is that they focus on the core features of the K-12 system. Through my domain driven design analysis using the K 12 website and the SEA a website of the North Carolina estate as information. We have identified approximately 110 or 120 or so features and operations, or clothes that need to be implemented to create a fully functional K-12 system. I recommend that the focus should be on the build out of all of the current features that have not been started and are not yet in progress.

Additionally, there has been a little attention given to some of the core crosscutting concerns that need to be in place to support the K-12 system. I have listed them in the current documents. All of the cross county concerns need to be integrated into the K-12 system features to support the management of providers, schools, and households with their students. Many of the K2 operations include renewals and recertification for households, schools and providers throughout the entire fiscal year. Therefore the cross cutting concerns are essential, not only during the enrollment of new providers schools or students, but also during the management of the existing users of the K-12 system.

They have been working on this project for over one year and we still do not have a completed database schema for the K-12 system. Minimally, we have a provider database schema that is incomplete. We do not have database schema to support the schools or households and students. We do not have other database schemes that support all of the 110 or more features of the application that need to be operational and need to connect the aggregate data elements together to form a cohesive solution.

Another risk factor for this project is that it is a secret project where the current administrators or builders or maintainers of the existing system cannot be accessed to provide detail, details or requirements or functional or no non-functional requirements for the current legacy system.

Therefore, a weekly meeting with a product owner equivalent at the client someone non-technical I assume is providing requirements. Peace me during these weekly meetings. We do not get a backup of the database or schema definitions from the database either. We receive file of Excel spreadsheets that have some data exports. We have to infer all of the data requirements from these Excel spreadsheets and other limited documentation from a contact contact at the client.

Again, I repeat my recommendation is to pause the build out of the enrollment builder solution. My recommendation is that we complete the collection or registration enrollment processes, using angular forms, reactive forms to manage the collection of the acquired data and to directly input that data into the core database schema. That we perform a focus on the core features of the system in a logical sequence. I also suggest that we put immediate focus on the migration of existing data and also create an operational database schema for the K-12 system.

It is my belief that the focus on the core K-12 system features might be too much work to complete within the seven month window of time for the targeted delivery date of May 1, 2026

Two of the IT stakeholders on the consulting side of the project or recommending from their communication with me to focus only on their enrollment builder solution and how we would complete or provide that solution without regard to the remaining core system features yet to be implemented or executed or developed. During a meeting yesterday they attempted to distill my research into a few bullet points into a decision matrix I feel that they are minimizing the risks and the core system features to be developed in order to save face for their mismanagement of the project and solution. Also, the issue of not understanding the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the K2 system And an entirely mismanaged solution for the last year that is produced really nothing.

instructions
I want you to crate for me a concise two or three paragraphs with bullet points that provide my opinion and proposal. Use all of the information provided in this issue and in the current repository. Do deep research on the existing documents in this repository to support my argument and proposal to not implement a solution that adds no value to this project. In fact, doing the enrollment builder creates a significant risk in the delivery of this system at large. I want the brief proposal or my opinion to be presented as a logical and legal brief.

To add some color, one or the original architect of the solution, checked out or gave up and was moved to a different project. Another architect brought in to replace him was on the project for eight months and quit last week. Additionally, a very senior and respected engineer left last Friday as a result of many issues not being listened to or suggestions not being followed, and a lack of technical directions from the current project team, including the IT stakeholders. Additionally, another enterprise architect has put in notice to leave the project as well. I’ve been on the project for one month and within this month, I have observed many of the issues that the current architects, engineers and product owners have seen. They do not understand why we need a complex enrollment builder that provides little value. They’ve seen and/or witnessed the lack of technical requirements and direction from IT stakeholders.
