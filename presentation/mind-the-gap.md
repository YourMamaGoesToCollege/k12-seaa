## London Underground

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES:
- A few years ago...traveled London; present at the Angular Connect conference.
- I was reminded of the phrase "Mind the Gap" as I navigated the London Underground (subway).
- London Underground: a rapid transit system serving London and some parts of the adjacent counties.
  - The world's first underground railway.
  - Opened in 1863.
  - 11 lines, 270 stations, 250 miles of track.

## The Gap

![width:340px](./assets/mind-the-gap.jpeg)

<!-- Speaker Notes: 
- Today we can take the tube and hire a flat. Later, we can do take away.
  - Take the "tube" to get around.
  - "Carry out..." in London it is "take away."
- Mind the Gap: a phrase used in the London Underground.
  - A warning to passengers to be cautious when crossing the gap between the train door and the station platform.
  - The gap is a potential hazard. "Watch your step."
-->

## Gap in Communication

![width:340px](./assets/gap-in-comm.png)

- Misunderstanding
- Misinterpretation
- Miscommunication

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- What is a common problem in communication (context: technology, software, development, etc.)?
  - Speaking the "same" language - but not communicating.
- Have you ever felt like you were speaking a different language?
  - Difficult to understand or be understood?
- Have you ever been part of a conversation and felt like you did not understand or fully track the direction of the discussion? 
- Perhaps you got a request to do something, with very little explanation or details? Therefore you had a lot of questions?
- Challenges: Working remotely has its set of challenges.
-->

---

### Lack of Understanding

<!-- ![width:340px](./assets/comm-without-understanding.png) -->
![width:340px](./assets/talking-no-comm.png)

<!--
Notes:
- They are talking, but not understanding each other.
- What could be the problem?
- Why are they not communicating effectively?

Answer this question and provide some guidance along the way.
We want to "mind the gap" in communication.
-->

---

## Communication

- Exchange of information
- Key to understanding
- Specialized Idioms and terminology in Business and Technology

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES:
- What is communication?
  - A useful exchange of information that leads to understanding.
- Dental industry
- Technical jargon (layer of application, etc.)
-->

---

### Purpose

- Thoughtful communication is key.
- Know your audience/partner in the conversation.
- Conveying information to promote understanding.
- Create a plan to ensure a successful outcome.

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES: 
- Be intentional, clear and concise.
- Prepare an agenda.
- Example: like playing catch; throwing the ball back and forth - an exchange until there is understanding.
-->

---

### Who or What?

Which is more important? What or Who?

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES: 
- The focus is mostly on the "what" (the content) and not the "who" (the audience).
- In a conversation, is who we are talking with more important or what we are talking about?
-->

---

### People

We need to know and understand the audience in our communication.

- Role
- Concerns
- Responsibilities

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES: 
- Is anyone context switching?
- Are they concerned about the: 
  - impact on the customer?
  - impact on the business?
  - cost and budget?
  - timeline?
  - security?
  - performance?
  - compliance?
  - user experience?
  - quality of the product?

- Each person has a different perspective and concerns.
- Their role and responsibilities will influence their concerns.
- Understanding their perspective will help you communicate effectively.
- May have different concerns at different stages of the project.
-->

---

## Speak the Same Language

- Common terminology
- Adapt our "message" to the audience
  - the "what" and "level of detail" needs to match the audience

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES: 
- deliver the "what" - but adjust the delivery/message to the audience.
  - Balance: provide the right amount of information.
- adjust/modify language to the audience
  - who (e.g., role, concerns, and responsibilities?
  - when (SDLC, stage of ideation, analysis, design, or implementation)?
  - what (i.e., topic)?
-->

---

## Forms of Communication

### Verbal

- Meetings
- Conversations

---

### Written

- Informational

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES: 
- Do not assume that everyone is on the same page - same understanding.
- Overview and business case.
- Value proposition.
- Requirements and specifications (business rules)
-->

---

### Visual

- Diagrams
- User Interface Mockups

<!-- SPEAKER NOTES:
Different artifacts help to communicate the context and details. Each artifact has a specific purpose and audience.
- level of detail
- C4 Models: Context, Containers, Components, and Code
- UML diagrams
- Domain Driven Design (DDD): Bounded Context, Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Services
- Domain Storytelling: Event Storming, User Story Mapping

- Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and user interface mockups.
- class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams
- data models
- Visual representation of the workflows.
- UI mockups help to visualize the user experience (low/high fidelity).
-->

---

## Communication Across Time - When?

There is a sequence of communication from the ideation phase to the implementation phase.

- Ideation, Feature Kickoff
- Analysis and Design
- Design Review
- Technical Planning
- Engineering Review
- Implementation

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Communication is not just a one-time event.
  - It is a sequence of events that occur over time.
  - loop back and forth between the stages/phases.
- Goes from context to detail.
  - high-level to low-level detail.
- Some organizations have a formal process for communication (defined workflow).
  - Future misunderstanding can be avoided by early communication.
  - Preparation of information. (documentation, diagrams, etc.) helps to communicate effectively.
-->

---

### Context-Level Communication

- Higher-level communication
  - more generalized - big picture
  - Ideation, Feature Kickoff
- Analysis and Design (beginning)

<!-- 
SPEAKER NOTES: 
- High-level communication.
- Identify the personas (who) and the concerns (what).
- What is the problem we are trying to solve?
  - User journey, user stories, and use cases.
- Identify the workflows.
- Focus on the "who", "what", and "why".
-->

---

### Context-Level Artifacts

There has to be a way to capture the context-level communication.

- written documentation
- visual diagrams

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES: We have to become comfortable with creating and using artifacts to capture the context-level communication.
- Common Problem: a lack of information to share
  - Written documentation
  - Visual diagrams
  - avoid the "meeting game" effect

- Written documentation
  - Accessible to all team members.
  - Clear and concise.
  - Maintained until understanding and alignment are achieved (i.e., a living document).
- Visual diagrams
  - Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and wire frames.
  - Visual representation of the workflows.
  - Helps to understand the context.
-->

---

### Detail-Level Communication

---

## Conclusion

- Recap of Key Points
- Q&A Session
- Final Thoughts and Takeaways

<!-- 
Speaker note: 
- Summarize the main points of the presentation, invite questions, and leave the audience with actionable takeaways. 
-->

## Resources

### Domain Storytelling

Domain Storytelling helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the domain and fostering collaboration in the development process.

### C4 Model

The C4 model is a way to help software development teams describe and design software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.

### Mind the Gap History

The phrase "Mind the gap" was coined in around 1968 for a planned automated announcement, after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. Because some platforms on the London Underground are curved, and the rolling stock that use them are straight, an unsafe gap is created when a train stops at a curved platform.[7] In the absence of a device to fill the gap, some form of visual and auditory warning is needed to advise passengers of the risk of being caught unaware and sustaining injury by stepping into the gap. The phrase "Mind the gap" was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms and heard on recorded announcements when a train arrives at many Underground stations.
