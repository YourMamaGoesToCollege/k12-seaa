Good morning - hey do you have a moment to connect briefly this AM?   I'd like to chat about if/how you've connected with Brandon and make a plan for you to have that opportunity.

GM-I'm checking back in on if/how you're getting info from Brandon - I was thinking we were targeting a meeting with him this week.   Is that still a plan or have you already connected with him?

I know he has some very strategic deliverables with the POC for the data M&T project. I was able to meet with him and team regarding the Query Builder tool/initiative - Jacqui and Architects. 

If the timing is better for him to finish/deliver the POC - I can definitely be flexible. 🙂

To my knowledge the urgent deliverable happened on 9/23.  Glad you were able to get Query builder intel.  Are there other hot topics that are "blockers" for you at this point?

,Sep 25, 1:04 PM,

,
Sep 25, 1:06 PM

He proposed the time/day - I think we are good. 

HOT TOPIC(S): One that has been on deck for the team for quite a while is the API strategy regarding MicroServices. I have met with each of the architects separately on the topic - and also a deeper dive with Elton and Terry yesterday. 

I think you and PVG need an update - we also need some additional support from different team members for PI3.

one more question i forgot to ask pursuant to the eariler conversation with Caitlyn.   I'm trying to assess whether there are significant other pieces of "data" that are currently entrenched in JIRA that we might benefit by identifying and linking on that same confluence page.   I'd just be looking for places where the requirements include granular details that are likely on a spreadsheet, for example, and I'm honestly not sure whether we have gotten the bulk of it through what Caitlyn/Eric shared or if there are other significant pieces that I could have someone track down.  Can you think of any?
,Oct 7, 2:22 PM,
You
,
Oct 7, 2:57 PM
,
I think you are right. I did not want to bring up the topic - I felt Jacqui was already triggered and defensive of our current process. I honestly have not seen this level of "gating" from a product perspective. Almost all team members have voiced frustration regarding the level of details and lack of requirements. 🙁
,Oct 7, 2:57 PM,
Jill Sorg
,
Oct 7, 3:01 PM

Thanks for sharing that perspective.  We do have the one legit challenge in that for confidentiality reasons we are not able to talk to the current system owners - so that is part of it, but are there other particular areas that we need to do some probing to see if there is other information available?

Somewhat related - how soon would be a reasonable time to regroup from today's meeting with the Phil's to determine next steps on Enrollment?   I or Phillip C can get that on the calendar
,Oct 7, 3:03 PM,

,
Oct 7, 3:09 PM

I will spend some time reviewing the Phil C. document and add my comments/observations about the proposal to finish the EB with Data Mapper. However, the solution has side-effects on the remaining work to be delivered. My feeling is that the current proposed estimate (FE only is 1.5 PI worth of work) - is not considered the BE/Data Mapper effort or estimation; and we should do our due diligence to include current and work items not started. 

I would like to see an overall timeline effect and. reset to determine if we are on the right track. With current EB, modified EB, or no EB (static reactive forms via Angular as v1) - we need to see if remaining work fits in the timeline.

I know JK is pulling up with the Dev POs on Thursday to revisit the product roadmap.   It seems that we're in a bit of a catch 22 because she's looking for decision on go forward path for EB (to determine whether to focus on that now, or pause, work on data mapping now, and then come back to EB at the end).  What inputs do we need to inform that recommendation?
,Oct 7, 3:13 PM,
You
,
Oct 7, 3:19 PM
,
The product roadmap needs to include some perspective of the technology roadmap (that should support and provide the foundational layers) so that we are building features in the correct order of sequence. For example, the household enrollment process has dependencies on providers and schools. We have teams working on Query Builder when there is not data to report on - should be later in the timeline of deliverables. 

I'm not sure what the current process is to determine what we are working on now/next. Some of the foundational elements of the the system are not complete/ready. I'd like an "inventory" of what is complete, somewhat-complete, not complete.

Hey Matt - I'm connecting with Wesley and Phillip C in a bit to attempt to visually document the current "architecture" supporting EB.  And I'm also taking a stab at documenting the challenges you raised this morning  - for the sake of working with you then articulate the potential solution(s) to those challenges and then take a stab at mapping out sequencing/timing .....    How does that sound for a plan?  Have time to reconnect late afternoon?    FYI - to add to the fun my teams is currently not working, so if you want to communicate with me please use google.

Thanks for your time and engagement today!   I cleaned up slides 12-15 if you want to take a look and see how close I came to accurately reflecting your thoughts.  Feel free to edit to make them right.  I think a good next step would be to indicate on each Risk -what you think is the best resolution and then that will inform go forward plan to vet with other key stakeholders.

Hi Matt - hope you had a good weekend (and that you keep coming back after these crazy weeks!)   I'm checking in on progress for putting together a recommendation on go forward plan for Enrollment Builder - after getting details from Wes... and Jacqui... and the POs.  Wes pinged today to see if there's any additional input or context you need from him - do you?   I thought I'd find a time either late today or tomorrow AM to synthesize your thoughts - would that be helpful?

See: https://cfi-nc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KR/pages/4510744587/Comparison+Summary+GitHub+Copilot+vs.+Cursor

Looking at the bigger picture and considering our client and security requirements: The obvious choice is Copilot. These were outlined in the proposal discussion. The assurance and security policies provided via the Copilot organization license are key.

I includd QA and DevOps in the initial counts. Luke mentioned that his team would use Copilot for DevOps scripting, templates, etc. 

see: https://cfiorg.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/K12Project/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6CBD32E0-8802-470F-ACC2-8539FC94EBA3%7D&file=K12%20Governance%20Model.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true

13 (developers from Teams Byers Dojo, Cobra Kai, and Miyagi Do
(8) users from PAT (aka Rex Kwando)
Matt Vaughn, Terry F. Rex S., Mario G., Ananda K., Angelo M, Stuart G., Luke S.


I did not include (2) from the Tiger Team (Wes and Brandon) or the QA team.

I do not expect variable costs for the amount of tokens we get for each developer. per month. We are only using the Copilot tool locally for development. We are not using any of the code repository capabilities of Github at this time.

Hi matt - hope you had a good holiday.    Two questions for you...  1.   Any update on copilot access before I go push on that again?  2.  This may likely merit a conversation, but with the progress on data seeding and the progress up date you provided related to workflow engine, do you now have a different level of confidence that we can deliver the required MVP by June?   We're planning to pull in Rob/Lauren with any issues/risks we have, so I'm looking to get an updated perspective of risk.  Let me know when you have time to connect on that topic.

Hey Jill - I still remembered my password...so we are all good! :). Based on the progress below, my level of confidence is a 3. We still have a lot of work to do from an architecture/infrastructure perspective - we now have a plan/direction and are executing during our current Sprints (much of this should have been place about a year ago). 

For example, #3 below for developer environment setup is not adequate today. The data/database issues should be relieved by the updated seeding strategy #2.

1. No word on Copilot subscriptions/accounts. If Dawn needs an assist, I am available. Not sure what the next steps are for CFI. 

2. Data Seeding: Harshal's team is moving forward with updating our seed data with more volume. They are working with DevOps (Luke) to create Entra accounts for an additional (20) household accounts; to also include email addresses. 

3. Workflow: we have an architecture defined for the backend. Our team is in the process of getting the updates into our code base; additionally, this work includes some updates to our local/developer setup to allow teams to develop locally with Docker containers.

Hi = Thx:  I'm following up on copilot to see what we need to do to get you moving in that.   In chatting with PVG, he's looking for what we are confident we can deliver by Jun 1.  Are there particular pieces of functionality that have the most risk?  What could we do (cut scope - even if painful-, bring in resources..... ) that would increase your confidence ?
