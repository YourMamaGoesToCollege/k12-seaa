 The message below was posted on MS Teams channels: K12 Project | K12 EagleFang Team | Microsoft Teams and K12 Project | K12 Cobra Kai Team | Microsoft Teams. Please let Bill Ewald know if you do not have access to your respective team channel, so that he can add you, as you need to be able to see messages there. I apologize if there was confusion over stand-up this morning.

Friday Lightning Round Standup!
Hi, everyone and happy Friday!
 
Bill is out sick today, and although I am back at work today, I have a conflict at standup. So today, let's do lightning round standup via Teams chat! If you have any issues, blockers, questions, concerns, etc. that you would have brought up at standup, please communicate those here. 
 
Hope everyone has a wonderful day!

Good news for Mac users w.r.t. new MS accounts:
It seems that the built-in Mac Calendar and Mail apps work with our new Microsoft (randstaddigital.us) accounts (they didn't in the past, at last as far as I could see). Good way to have your Google and Microsoft calendars in one place.

Please join me in welcoming Jill Sorg to the team! She joins us as a project manager on K12. Jill will wear a number of hats, including supporting the sprint teams in their daily operations. In this role she will partner with Bill to track progress and execution and to evaluate our performance against our estimates and commitments. For now she will be focusing on Teams 1 & 2. Jill will also work with Patrick to deliver a first class UAT experience to SEAA, and in the coming weeks she will begin to look at our readiness/transition/cutover process to ensure a seamless completion for K12. I'm excited to have her join us, and I believe she represents one of the last pieces of the puzzle for us to effectively complete the last legs of this race.

She is in the process of handing off any work she had ongoing, but if you have any questions for her, it's not like she's going anywhere. I'm confident (and I'm speaking for you here Paula) that she'd be more than happy to support you in the future.

Team,
We had our monthly Product Demo with SEAA stakeholders on Monday, and I wanted to pass along some exciting feedback Katie shared with me today.
One of the SEAA developers was so impressed with what he saw that he’s already borrowing our ideas and implementing them into his own application—talk about influence!
I showcased the My Documents feature and In-App Messaging, and he specifically praised the progress we've made with messaging. After seeing our My Docs demo, he even went ahead and implemented the carat feature for versioning and organizing documents into his own system.

The overall response from stakeholders was extremely positive—they’re genuinely excited about what’s coming next!

Huge kudos to the entire team for delivering a product that’s not just meeting expectations—it’s inspiring others. Your hard work, attention to quality, and commitment to excellence is absolutely hitting the mark.

Thank you for being rockstars. Let’s keep the momentum going!

Hi team. I'm back from my little vacation, and I'm trying to get my head wrapped back around all of this work-related nonsense 😂 I'm delighted to be able to announce that we are joined as of today by our new architect, 
Elton Trotman
. Please join me in welcoming him to the team. I'll be providing you more details over the next couple of days about the new team structure and assignments, and at this point I'm just waiting for final approval from the client so that we can start discussing this topic. I anticipate being able to start those discussions by the end of the day today.

Welcome to Elton!

Good afternoon team. I am going to update Confluence in a moment with the new team organizational structure that will be live as of June 1st. For ease of access I'll drop a copy of it here for you. If you have any questions or recommendations related to the structure I would be happy to discuss. I am excited about this structure and approach, and I feel that our team has evolved in a healthy and useful way.  Here is the full document (K12 Governance Model.pptx)

Team, as usual, you can work and bill next Monday (Memorial Day) if you like, but I would need a detailed list of what you worked on and approval from your lead (with confirmation). This is audited by CFI and by SEAA, so we need to show our math if we're going to bill them on their published holidays, but as long as you're willing to go through all that handling you're welcome to work/bill.

Hi team, this message is to apprise you of a staffing change that occurred on Friday: John Grant is no longer with the K12 team. This decision followed an extended period of discussions with John to address concerns (both mine and his). I understand that this news may prompt questions in the team. If you would like to discuss the transition, I am at your disposal. Let me be clear that I have no other staffing changes in mind, and that John leaving the team was not something I had anticipated (I expected we would find more productive ways to remedy our respective concerns).

Huge kudos to the entire K12 program team!
First-time PI Planning is a little like assembling IKEA furniture without the instructions—confusing at first, but somehow, we ended up with something pretty impressive.

Thank you all for your patience, flexibility, and brainpower. Despite the ambiguity going in, this team rose to the occasion and crushed it. The insights, the risks, the dependencies, the “ah-ha” moments—pure gold. You laid the groundwork for smoother, smarter planning sessions moving forward.

Special shoutouts:    
Kim Yarborough
 and 
Jacquelyn Hopkins
  for sitting in the “hot seat” like champs for two straight days. MVPs of mental stamina.

Jill Sorg
  for keeping the chaos at bay and guiding us like a PI Planning sherpa.

We’ll keep getting better from here—thanks to all of you. Nicely done, team!

Morning team. I just learned that we can't use auto forwarding on our outlook email accounts. A number of us, myself included, set up forwarding to make it easier to monitor both systems, and apparently it's throwing an error that kicks back to cfi's admins. I'm going to go ahead and turn mine off, and if you've activated yours, please turn off yours as well. Thanks.

Good morning! This thursday is Juneteenth, and it is a holiday for CFI (not for SEAA). You are welcome to work and charge the day if you like, but as usual, please provide me with specifically what you accomplished and be prepared to show your math in the event that we get audited. I am going to try to take thursday and friday off, as I just found out that my wife has a four-day weekend, but I don't know if I can actually swing it. If you're able to take a bit of time, I really recommend you do. I know how intense the last few weeks have been. A bit of time to decompress might not be a bad idea.

I just posted the following blurb into teams, but I know that can be difficult for all of us on the Randstad side to follow in real time. So I'll drop it here as well for your convenience. 

Hi team. We have decided to move to a four product owner model, with each product owner aligned directly to one of the teams. As we work to staff the additional two product owners, Kim and Jacquelyn will continue to support two teams each (CK/MD and EF/BD respectively). Instead of having BAs aligned to teams, they will now float across Epics, assigned to specific efforts by Jacqui and the product owners. Additionally, we have switched the teams for Jason and Bradley. Please support them as they come up to speed on the scope responsibilities for their new teams. The goal of these continuing refinements is to maximize team efficiency and to continue to improve the speed and quality of our stories. I have updated the governance model with these changes. If you have any recommendations or feedback, please reach out, and let's discuss. Thanks for your support!

Hi Team,

I wanted to let you know that Jason Dean has decided to leave, effective immediately. While this news wasn't completely unexpected, it was a bit sudden. However, I understand that recent personal matters have significantly influenced his decisions.

Given the abruptness of Jason's departure, please connect with your product owners and leads to address any immediate loose ends or challenges that arise. Your flexibility is greatly appreciated!

On a positive note, we have two new senior full-stack developers joining us over the next few weeks, and they will be stepping into the roles left by John - and now by Jason. We also have two new POs starting shortly. These additions will help us build momentum and capacity, and hopefully they will also improve the team's overall experience. 

I'll be setting up one-on-one chats with each of you very soon. I want to use these conversations to touch base, hear your thoughts, and ensure your needs are being met. It's not uncommon for teams to experience some turnover as we reach the midpoint in our delivery timeline. Let's take this opportunity to talk through any concerns and refocus on the exciting bigger picture of what we're building together.

Here is my usual holiday charging message ;-)     July 4th is a holiday for CFI and Randstad. You are welcome to work and charge the day if you like, but as usual, please provide your PO with specifically what you accomplished and be prepared to show your math in the event that we get audited.  <<< regarding this last:  we WILL get audited at some point, and it will be by the State. When that happens please make sure you really can show your work. I cannot stress this enough. I've been warned by SEAA that this is coming, and that they don't mess around. So just please be ready.

I WAS entering a brief summary of what I was doing in the timesheet details, but that's not technically evidence.  I suppose commits for us are the only real proof.

Said another way, I'm okay with you filling your 40hrs on the other days on a week with one day landing on a holiday. But... you should take extra care to be able to show 40hrs of work for WHEN we get audited.

I am delighted to introduce three new team members to the family: Gova, Harshal, and Norm. As we’ve discussed in the past, Gova and Harshal will be the new POs for MD and BD respectively, and Norm will be joining as a Senior Frontend Dev on Eagle Fang. We were also supposed to be joined today by Thomas Franey, but due to some Randstad red tape that won’t happen until later this week (hopefully tomorrow). Please join me in welcoming them to the team!

Hi Team, 

We are excited to announce the formation of a new Agile Core Team, effective for PI2. This team will focus on delivering "enabler" epics and stories, including architecture, DevOps, and data migration activities.

The new team will comprise all Architects and DevOps members, along with a new data engineer and a platform engineer. Eric Boysen will also join to support data migration efforts.

This change aims to bring several key benefits:
Enhanced Transparency: Gaining clearer insight into the work supported by this team.
Centralized Expertise: Establishing a single point of contact for architectural and DevOps-related questions and decisions.
Improved Visibility: Providing better visibility into team capacity and prioritization.
Streamlined Dependency Management: Supporting effective cross-team dependency management and work timing.
Reduced Duplication: Mitigating potential oversights or redundant efforts related to enabler work.

The team will adopt a Kanban approach, with Bill Ewald serving as Scrum Master. Luke and Brandon will share Product Owner responsibilities.

Thank you all for your ongoing commitment to enhancing our Agile practices and improving delivery across our ART.

I'll also post this on Teams for our Emergent and CFI compatriots.

Wesley Song

Mario Giambanco

Luke Samuels
. What you've all accomplished in this past year, navigating such high-pressure and demanding situations, is truly amazing. Against all odds, we're on track to deliver this critical platform on budget and on time, and that's a testament to your exceptional talent and relentless dedication (and perhaps just a pinch of masochism). I couldn't be more appreciative of your partnership, and I'm genuinely excited to see what we'll achieve together as we drive to completion over the next year. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done!

Potentially. Once we receive the key we can perform a spike that helps us better understand the best course of action. My gut tell me we'd probably want to store the final signed doc for fast/easy retrieval from our azure storage.

so the plan still stands (brad and i are currently fixing up my documents endpoints)
keep the files on blob storage
presumably the download link could be passed to PandDoc

ok thanks everyone... I thought we should be able to use the app but for some reason mine is not allowing me to log in... the first IT person I spoke to said it was because I am on windows 10 and need a new laptop... but I just spoke with someone else and they said that Randstad can only issue a license for our onmicrosoft account and not the randstaddigital.us account so he said I can only use the browser version... but I didn't think that was right

This is what Google says: Yes, the Microsoft Teams app works on Windows 10, but requires a recent version of the operating system, such as Windows 10 version 22H2 or later, to support the new Teams app. You can install it by downloading the app from the Microsoft Teams download page or through the Microsoft Store.

Randstad has already acknowledged that they need to replace the windows 10 computers, and it's been established that this is the root cause of the problem that you're having. As you and I discussed a couple of weeks ago, I just need you to make sure that I get pulled in when that request goes through so that I can provide cost center information if required. In the interim, the browser version is functionally identical to the application version, so I'm not sure I see there being any real impact.

Hello team. As per usual you are welcome to work the holiday if you like, but I will need 1) pre-approval from your PO, and 2) demonstrable proof of outcomes created (code checked in and the like) prior to approving the hours. I was asked to provide proof for two people (randomly selected, I believe) from the last holiday, and I was easily able to do so, which I very much appreciated. So please keep up the good work in that regard.

It looks like we have a really good mix of features to share that will be exciting to demo.  There is a lot of diversity here which will go over well with our stakeholders.  

Please talk to your PO directly if you have any concerns. 
Thanks!!!

We may need clearer definition on what we are and are not allowed to record. Why are requirements gathering sessions ok to record, but demos are not? If someone were to request them under FOIA, is there anything that is "non-compliant". I would like to better understand.

Let me turn that around, and say that recordings may be made only by exception - in any category: demo, requirements gathering, etc.. Furthermore, any recordings, even in the rare instances that they are allowed, have a retention period that must be identified, tracked, and adhered to. So, to be clear, except in specific instances where Katie has given her written permission, ALL recordings must be deleted. For any recordings that are perceived to be authorized, please send me a link to the folder, and I will review the retention schedule.

Locate the folder: Under "My Drive," find the folder named "Meet Recordings". 
Check for the file: The recording file will be in this folder, usually named with the meeting title and date.

@ y'all,

I wanted to share some news: I’ve been offered a role outside of this project that aligns closely with my long-term career interests and trajectory. Given how the job market has been, it’s a rare full-time opportunity I couldn’t pass up. My last day here will be Friday, October 10th. Until then, I’m happy to backfill any missing information or wrap up anything currently in-flight.

I’m also encouraged to hear about some positive changes on the horizon for better organization, more collaborative planning, and greater visibility into the core issues we all work so hard to address. Please know this decision isn’t a reflection on the project, Phillip’s constant monologues about Pokémon Go, his borderline obsession with Charizard, or anything else in particular.  The challenges here are just another problem to solve —and problem-solving is exactly what this team does here every day.  Be on the lookout for a new project pest!

I truly wish you all the best and hope our paths cross again down the road.

...And of course, feel free to reach out if you’d like my address to send beer, money, or to be strange pals on LinkedIn..

Does anyone know if we have a preference for Software/Engineering diagram tools? I would prefer Lucid over Visio - to allow for simultaneous collaboration. Lucid charts can imbed directly into Confluence, where Visio can provide only a link/URL to the document from what I understand.

I feel like there are some diagrams on confluence that other people are doing up.  I'm not entirely sure I have the answer, but we may have licensing for something (Robert/Elton may know the answer to this since they're constantly creating diagrams).

That last question from Betsy was prescient. I think we all know what the real answer to that question was, and we're in deep discussions right now trying to sort out a reasonable and deliverable solution. Obviously, I am talking about our good friend Enrollment Builder and her cousin, Data Mapper.

Hi team. 

Robert Beasy elected to resign from Randstad, effective immediately. Please work with Matt Vaughn to identify any areas in which you will require support and handoff. We have already kicked off the process to staff a new applications architect. If you have any questions please reach out to me.

Team,

I know the recent departures of Bradley (end of this week) and Robert (yesterday/suddenly) have likely created uncertainty, and I want to assure you that we are moving quickly to stabilize our teams. 

Here is where we stand:

Bradley’s Role: We have successfully identified a backfill (interviewed & approved by Bradley Actual), and the new team member will be joining us Monday the 20th. We will coordinate a swift onboarding process and engage him in Dev Syncs ASAP.

Robert’s Role: We are actively engaged in conversations to secure coverage for this critical position. We will update you as soon as we have a firm timeline for a dedicated replacement.

In the interim, please continue to prioritize your planned work. If you encounter any immediate concerns related to the PAT team’s backlog or otherwise, please route them to Matt Vaughn or bring them directly to me.

Thank you for your professionalism and dedication as we navigate this transition. Your focus on delivering value remains paramount.

My door is open if anybody wants to talk. 

Phil

Good afternoon team! I had two quick notes I wanted to share with you. The first is that I am back and dangerous again! The covid was fun, and the pneumonia was even more fun, but they are now both in my rear view mirror. 

The second thing I wanted to note is that the team went through extensive discussions last week around the viability of Enrollment Builder both in terms of its technical viability and also in terms of our ability to deliver it in the timeframe that we committed to. The outcome of that analysis is that we are going to continue with Enrollment Builder, and we are now in a refined planning stage to zero in on scope (EB, Data Mapper, etc.), risks, LoE (level of effort), and critical path activities. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good morning team!

I'm excited to announce several key enhancements to our team structure that represent the final strategic moves to round out our delivery capability. My goal is simple: to ensure you have a structure that is both empowering and fully supportive of our high-stakes mission at CFI.

Here are the details on the new leadership and structure:
Terry Fraser will be stepping into the role of Enterprise Architect.
Mario Giambanco will transition to Applications Architect. We will be restaffing his Frontend Lead role on Cobra Kai, and Mario will graciously dual-hat during this transition (thank you, Mario!).
Nick Lechnowskyj joins us on Monday as the Backend Lead for Cobra Kai.

Introducing Our New Principal Software Engineers

Another key strategic shift is the introduction of a newly formed leadership role: Principal Software Engineer. Both Chad Beard and Nick Lechnowskyj will be taking on this responsibility. They will remain heavily involved in coding and direct team leadership, but will also partner with Matt Vaughn to drive cross-team alignment and engineering maturity across the entire platform.

This means they will be dedicated to:
Defining technical standards.
Improving process consistency.
Solving tricky design patterns.
Bridging communication gaps across the program.

I am thrilled about what these combined enhancements mean for our team’s capabilities, especially in terms of reducing friction and accelerating our path to delivery. This new structure positions us perfectly to finish this critical product. If you have any questions or recommendations on how we can further leverage this expertise, please reach out!

Phil

Team Re-Alignment: Sharp Focus on Key Deliverables 🚀

Hi team. We're making some strategic shifts to get even more effective and efficient, focusing on our biggest priorities.

1. Dedicated Focus on EB & DM
We're dedicating a laser-focused team to drive the Enrollment Builder (EB) and Data Mapper (DM) to completion, effective immediately:
Eagle Fang is now 100% focused on EB/DM.
Phillip Cartwright will be the PM, using a modified Agile approach to lead the push.
Brandon, Wes, Sneha, and Suchi are dedicated to this critical stream.

2. Strategic Resource & PO Shifts
To keep momentum strong elsewhere, we’re strategically moving resources and aligning our Product Owners (POs):
The remaining Eagle Fang members will be distributed to bolster the Cobra Kai and Byers Dojo teams.
Kim is moving her technical expertise to become the Product Owner for the PAT team, ensuring tight technical/product alignment.
JHop will transition to Cobra Kai as their PO.

3) Next Steps & Timing
The EB/DM focus starts now. For the rest of the PI, your respective Product Owners will coordinate the exact timing of resource moves. We know this is a lot of movement, but it’s been planned to help us execute faster and better on our shared goals. Check the updated Governance documentation for the new org chart.

Thanks for your flexibility and continued commitment to delivering value. I'm open to additional recommendations or concerns! For my part, I think our ability to shift nimbly to respond to evolving situations speaks well of the team, and I appreciate you!

Hey team....just a reminder that when you are creating any backlog item, it needs to have a Parent.  This includes, RAID items, Bugs, Stories, Tasks, etc.  If you are creating something and you don't know where it should go, please work with your PO or SM.  

If your SM reaches out and asks you to update your items, please do so.  

Thank you for helping me to keep the backlog as clean as possible!

To go through one room to another, you have to unzip a plastic barrier and then rezip it.

Team, I would like to announce two staffing changes that will be taking place as of next Friday (11/7). Brandon D'Alleva and Elton Trotman will both be leaving the team. Each of them have been an invaluable part of our success thus far, and they will be missed. Brandon's role is currently going through the interview process, and I'm working with Matt and his team to identify the requirements for a platform engineer that will replace Elton's capacity. I wish both of you guys the very best going forward, and I appreciate everything you've done for us. Let me know if anybody has any questions.

In other news...       ;-)

As we continue to fine-tune our structure to meet the MVP deadline and timeline, we have a couple of new incremental updates to our structure. Thanks for staying flexible throughout these tweaks—they are all designed to help us execute most efficiently. You can view the full details in the updated Org Model Document, but here are the key changes:

> Strategic Re-Prioritization

The most significant change is that we are strategically moving the remainder of the Enrollment Builder (EB) development to the end of the timeline. This is to better align our delivery with the point at which EB will be needed in SEAA's annual operating calendar. To maximize our momentum now, we will disperse the members of Eagle Fang across the other teams (this will happen over the next couple of weeks as they complete their current work). This shift allows us to accelerate critical work happening in the near term.

> Clarity on Shared Resources

For organizational clarity, I've moved all the QA and UX/UI names into separate pools in the org document. This is purely to clarify assignments, as these will continue to be shared resources across multiple workstreams.

Please take a moment to review the updated org model. Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!

Hi. The key assignments for the QA testers will remain unchanged, and I have added those key assignments next to their names to avoid further confusion. 
Patrick Crawford
 may in some cases use these folks across other workstreams to support the flow of work.

Good evening team. I have a staffing update to share. Effective immediately, Thomas Franey (Full Stack Developer on Byer’s Dojo) is no longer with Randstad.

I recognize that any abrupt departure of a team member can cause immediate concern, and I understand this marks the second sudden departure in a short timeframe. I want to assure you that this change, while unexpected in its timing, does not derail our larger roadmap or commitments. We have already initiated the search and onboarding plan to re-staff this role quickly and ensure minimal disruption to the existing backlog.

To ensure stability, Harshal and Chad are already partnering to ensure that all commitments we’ve made will be met or carefully rescheduled and that Thomas’s immediate workload is properly distributed.

It is absolutely critical that we maintain the Professional Standards and bearing expected of us by our client and by one another. We must abide by our established ways of working, to include attending team meetings and utilizing the established tool sets (Jira and Confluence). Even more importantly, we must consistently behave in a professional and supportive manner with our teammates (we're in this together guys!). These behaviors represent us as a company and as professionals, and they are non-negotiable for our collective success.

I am happy to be a sounding board for anyone who would like to discuss how this departure impacts your current workload or our team processes. 

Thank you all for your focus and dedication as we move forward.

🎄 Holiday Work Policy and Documentation Requirements

Hi Team,
As we approach the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, I want to clarify our policy regarding working during those periods.

General Policy:
You are welcome to work during the holiday weeks, provided you adhere to your usual maximum of 40 hours for the work week.
Working during the company holidays themselves is fine, provided the work is genuinely necessary and productive.

Critical Requirement for Holiday Dates: For the following company-observed holidays, specific documentation is needed before time card approval:
Thanksgiving: November 27th and 28th
Christmas: December 24th and 25th

Action Required for Time Approval: If you charge time for any of the four dates listed above, you must submit evidence of the work performed.
Before submitting your time card for the relevant week, please proactively send me documentation (e.g., specific deliverables, summarized activities, commits, or proof of output) that clearly justifies the hours charged. We will be audited.
This proactive approach ensures I have easy access to the required evidence for quick approval and storage. Please don't make me hunt for it! 

Thank you for your support and for being proactive on this matter. If you have any questions about this policy, please let me know. Happy Holidays!

As we head into the New Year, I want to wish everyone a happy and safe holiday. Reflecting on the last 20+ months, it is impressive to see how this group has evolved into such a cohesive and high-performing team. The continued respect our client (and their client) holds us in is a direct result of your marvelous work, and that is an achievement in itself. The next seven months will be our most intense and exciting yet as we wrap up this multi-year journey. I’m looking forward to this final chapter and staying the course to deliver on our commitments together—I couldn't ask for a better group of professionals to finish this with. Thank you for everything you do!

Edited,
Team, regarding Mural, a couple of people were having access issues today, and I now know the root cause. If you don't log into Mural at least once every 14 days, your access is locked. If that happens, just message me, and I now have the ability to unlock people. I wish I also had the ability to extend that window, but I have not been awarded such vast powers at this time. Eric and JH, you should be back in business.

so keeping mural open does not count for the login 14 days... I guess, logout every week and log back in on a Monday may be best?

Team, it appears Vincent's laptop flatlined, and he is working with IT to try and resuscitate it. Just FYI.
