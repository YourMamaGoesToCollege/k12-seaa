# Admin Portal Operations

## Overview

This domain is defined as the **operational core for SEAA staff** and delivers the complete administrative toolset required to manage the K-12 scholarship programs.

The 30+ features collectively implement the necessary operational and decision-making workflows across the entire scholarship lifecycle. They fall into the following critical areas:

### 1. Verification Management

This feature set manages the legally mandated verification processes:

* **Domicile Verification:** Staff tools to review and manage domicile status, including electronic verification results received via the **seven state agency integrations** (DMV, DPI, Department of Revenue, DHHS, Department of Commerce, and State Board of Elections). It supports document evidence review (e.g., utility bills, bank statements) and manual override capabilities.
* **Income Verification (OS):** Functions supporting the **4% random sample selection** and identification of error-prone applications. This includes workflows for **IRS transcript validation** and non-compliance handling, which can result in award revocation.
* **Application Verification Sampling:** The administrative workflows necessary for random selection, case creation, documentation request management, and processing non-cooperation.

### 2. Application Processing and Review

These features enable SEAA staff to manage the high volume of applications:

* **Application Intake & Queue Management:** Tools for managing the queue of submitted applications, checking completeness, and handling data validation.
* **Eligibility Determination:** Functionality for staff to evaluate eligibility criteria, perform income calculations, review disability documentation (for ESA+), and record the final eligibility decision.
* **Exception Handling:** Workflows dedicated to managing and resolving exceptions, handling appeals, and assigning applications to specific reviewers.

### 3. Award Management

The administrative capabilities controlling the awarding process:

* **Lottery Administration:** Tools for creating lottery batches, processing random selections, managing priority period preferences, and maintaining a complete **audit trail**.
* **Award Calculation:** System features that manage the complex logic for **ESA+ award amount determination** ($9,000 vs. $17,000), **OS tiered award calculation** (income-based), **dual award ordering logic** (OS before ESA+), and integration of the annual **Per Pupil Allocation** data from DPI.
* **Award Lifecycle:** Management of award offers, tracking acceptance deadlines, and processing mid-year adjustments, suspension, termination, and renewal processing.

### 4. Reporting, Analytics, and Case Management

The administrative front end utilizes the underlying cross-cutting platform services:

* **Operational Dashboards:** Provide staff with metrics on the application pipeline status, processing time, verification completion rates, and payment disbursement status.
* **Compliance Reports:** Tools for generating **statutory reporting**, audit trail exports, financial reconciliation data, and state agency coordination reports.
* **Document Management:** Features for processing document uploads, review workflows, securing storage, and managing the **PandaDocs integration for e-signatures**.
* **Case Management:** Includes tools for running **bulk communication campaigns**, automating deadline reminders, and managing the exception queue.
* **System Administration:** Tools for **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, user account management, and Microsoft Entra ID integration.

### Strategic Context for Delivery

The decision to implement these 30+ features using **Angular reactive forms** (Option B) was made strategically to ensure that these mission-critical administrative functions could be **delivered on time** by the **May 1, 2026 hard deadline**. The alternative, continuing work on the dynamic Enrollment Builder (Option A), would have delayed the completion of these essential operational workflows by at least six months. The Admin Portal Operations features are crucial, as they represent the mechanism for executing the core business logic and compliance checks of the entire system.
