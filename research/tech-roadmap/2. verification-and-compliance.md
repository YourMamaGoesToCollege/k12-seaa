# 2. Verification and Compliance

? This domain, **Verification & Compliance**, is one of the six core capability areas of the K-12 SEAA modernization project, comprising **15+ features**. Its primary function is to ensure regulatory adherence and eligibility across both the ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship programs.

## Overview

The work within this domain is concentrated in **Phase 3** (Advanced Workflows & Admin Features) and **Phase 6** (Compliance & Reporting) of the implementation roadmap.

### Key Functional Components

The Verification & Compliance domain implements legally mandated workflows and ongoing monitoring:

1. **Eligibility Verification Workflows:** This includes systems for domicile determination, income verification (for OS), and disability verification (for ESA+).
2. **Ongoing Compliance Monitoring:** This includes tracking annual verifications such as the DPI per pupil allocation update (due December 1), school testing compliance (due July 15), school financial reviews (for schools with 70+ students), provider credential renewals, and background check renewals.
3. **Audit and Compliance Reporting:** This capability area also includes audit and compliance reporting features.

### Mandatory Verification Sampling (4% Rule)

A critical component of this domain is the mandatory process of **application verification sampling**, which is dictated by state statute (G.S. 115C-562.3).

* **Sampling Rate:** The Authority must verify **4% of scholarship applications** annually.
* **Selection Criteria:** This 4% sample must include both applications selected randomly and those identified as **error-prone**.
* **Process Guidance:** The verification process must follow federal verification requirements, often referencing the guidance used for free and reduced-price lunch applications.
* **Non-Cooperation:** The domain manages the handling of non-cooperation. If a household fails to cooperate by providing the required documentation by the set deadline, the Authority must **revoke the award**.

### Critical State Agency Integrations

The success of the verification process is critically dependent on **integrations with seven state agencies**. This is identified as a **HIGH-RISK** area due to the complexity and reliance on external coordination.

**1. Agencies Involved:** The seven required agencies are:
    ***DMV** (Division of Motor Vehicles)
    *   **DPI** (Department of Public Instruction)
    ***Department of Revenue**
    *   **DHHS** (Department of Health and Human Services)
    ***Department of Commerce**
    *   **State Board of Elections**
    *   **State CIO** (Chief Information Officer)

**2. Purpose of Integrations:** These integrations are mandatory for domicile and income verification, allowing the electronic exchange of data. The statutes require state agencies to cooperate expeditiously via electronic or similarly effective means.

**3. Implementation Timeline:** The State Agency Integration Framework is initiated in **Phase 3** (Weeks 13-16, starting in January 2026).

**4. Risk Mitigation:** Because State Agency Delays pose a high risk to the schedule, the project plan incorporates **manual fallback workflows** for each agency, which allows the project to proceed temporarily with manual verification if electronic integration is delayed.

### Specific Verification Tasks Implemented

The Admin Portal Operations domain includes specific tasks related to Verification & Compliance:

| Verification Type                  | Workflow Details                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domicile Verification**          | Relies on electronic verification priority via state agencies (DMV, DPI, Revenue, DHHS, Commerce, Elections). It manages multi-evidence coordination and manual override capabilities. |
| **Income Verification (OS)**       | Includes 4% random sample selection, identification of error-prone applications, IRS transcript validation, and non-compliance handling.                                               |
| **Disability Verification (ESA+)** | Involves the review of the Eligibility Determination Document (EDD) and IEP/504 plans, and verification of prior public school enrollment.                                             |
| **Per Pupil Allocation**           | Requires the system to track the annual update of the average State per pupil allocation from DPI by the **December 1 deadline**.                                                      |

The successful delivery of these legally mandated verification workflows is listed as a critical success factor for the entire project.
